# Ute CSS

A minimal CSS utility library without a build step

## Philosophy

Simple, single file CSS that can be easily understood and used without build tools.

When your project gets more serious, add a build step for better browser support and compression.

## How to use

When starting out, it can be daunting to remember all the class names. The best way to reference names is to search `ute.css` for the style that you would write, if you were creating your own class.

Use the examples on the [demo page](./index.html) to see how the classes work together to achieve common UI components.
